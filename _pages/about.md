I am Professor of Linguistics at the Université de Paris, UFR d’Etudes anglophones and Fellow of Labex EFL (Empirical Foundations of Linguistics). My research areas include semantics and pragmatics from a crosslinguistic perspective with a focus on English and French. I have worked on Tense, Aspect, Modality and Evidentiality. I have recently been investigating expressive speech acts, more specifically the expression of emotions in non-canonical questions.
